# node-express-nunjucks
## Basic node-express using nunjucks as template engine

## Introduction
This is a very basic example on using nunjucks with Node.js and Express

Nunjucks is a very powerful template engine that is suited to Node.js applications

## Usage

npm i
npm run nodemon

## Description

This is as basic as it gets to use nunjucks with Node.js and Express (Note you should use express.Router and place your routes in a separate file - I have not here to make the example simple)

All nunjuck files go in the views folder - extension of these files are .njk

Of course, you should really separate the back end endpoints into another project, here we have backend and frontend tied together.
